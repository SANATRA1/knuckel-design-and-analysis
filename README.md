ANSYS Modal Analysis of a Go-Kart Knuckle Design

I recently conducted a modal analysis study in ANSYS to evaluate the dynamic behavior of a go-kart knuckle design (without bearings). The simulation aimed to identify natural frequencies, mode shapes, and potential deformation characteristics under vibrational loading conditions.

The analysis revealed 10 distinct natural frequencies ranging from 174.29 Hz to 1533.2 Hz. Of particular interest were the 5th mode (803.16 Hz) and 10th mode (1533.2 Hz), which exhibited maximum deformation magnitudes of 85.781 mm and 87.2 mm respectively. These results indicate potential resonance risks if the component experiences vibrational excitation within these frequency ranges during operation.

The simulation highlighted FreeParts[13] as a critical area, consistently demonstrating the highest displacement across multiple modes. The knuckle was modeled using low carbon steel (annealed) with a total mass of approximately 3.0 kg. The inertia properties showed some asymmetry, suggesting the need for balance verification in physical testing.

Based on these findings, design improvements should focus on reinforcing FreeParts[13] through structural modifications such as increased wall thickness or rib supports. Additionally, incorporating vibration damping solutions would be advisable to mitigate potential resonance effects in the 803-1533 Hz range.

This study had certain limitations, including the absence of pre-stress conditions from operational loads and potential opportunities for mesh refinement in stress concentration areas. Future work will incorporate coupled static and dynamic loading conditions to better simulate real-world performance.

I welcome discussions on simulation methodologies, design optimization strategies, or potential applications in automotive engineering. The intersection of computational analysis and mechanical design continues to offer valuable insights for component development.
